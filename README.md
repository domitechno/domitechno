# 👻 Hello everyone!

I'm Yoann (but everyone calls me Domi for some reasons), i'm currently a computer science student based in Paris.

I'm also a self-proclaimed passionate software developer who loves diving into every aspect of coding. Whether it's about analyze some data, crafting AI or building serious projects, I'm always ready when bringing ideas to life with some code. My goal is to become an AI/ML engineer one day thats why I keep learning and improve my skills as much as I can a little bit everyday
