#👻 Hello everyone!

I'm Yoann (but everyone calls me Domi for some reasons), i'm currently and computer science student based in Paris.

I'm also a self-proclaimed passionate software developer who loves diving into every aspect of coding. Whether it's about crafting beautiful user interfaces or building serious projects, I'm always ready when bringing ideas to life with some code.
